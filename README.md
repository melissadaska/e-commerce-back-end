## Description

This week we built the back end for an e-commerce site using a working Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

This is very useful for a manager at an internet retail company that watns a back end for their e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies. It will allow the company to compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Screenshots
Below are screenshots testing the routes in Insomnia to get all categories, get a category by id, create a category, update a category, and delete a category. Even though only category images are shown, you can also do this with the products and tags.
